# Enhanced Anti-Overfitting Training System

## Overview

This enhanced training system implements state-of-the-art techniques to combat overfitting in deep learning models for batik classification. The system addresses the key issues identified in your previous training results:

- **High training accuracy (98.56%) vs validation accuracy (82.54%)** - indicating overfitting
- **Extreme class performance variations** - some classes achieve 100% while others get 0%
- **Early stopping at epoch 38** - model stopped improving after epoch 33

## Key Improvements

### 1. Advanced Data Augmentation
- **Mixup**: Linear interpolation between samples and labels
- **CutMix**: Cut and paste augmentation with label mixing

### 3. Regularization Techniques
- **Enhanced Dropout**: Increased dropout rate to 0.7
- **Weight Decay**: Increased to 2e-3 for better regularization
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients
- **Early Stopping**: More aggressive patience (7 epochs)

### 4. Advanced Learning Rate Scheduling
- **Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts**: Better convergence
- **OneCycleLR**: Alternative scheduling strategy
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Traditional plateau-based scheduling

### 5. Test Time Augmentation (TTA)

## Technical Details

### Mixup Implementation
```python
def mixup_data(x, y, alpha=0.2, device='cuda'):
    lam = np.random.beta(alpha, alpha)
    index = torch.randperm(batch_size)
    mixed_x = lam * x + (1 - lam) * x[index]
    return mixed_x, y, y[index], lam
```

### CutMix Implementation
```python
def cutmix_data(x, y, alpha=1.0, device='cuda'):
    # Generate random bounding box
    # Mix images and labels
    # Return mixed data and original labels
```

### Label Smoothing
```python
class LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, smoothing=0.1):
        self.smoothing = smoothing
    
    def forward(self, x, target):
        confidence = 1. - self.smoothing
        # Smooth the target distribution
```

### Focal Loss
```python
class FocalLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, alpha=1, gamma=2):
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.gamma = gamma
    
    def forward(self, inputs, targets):
        # Focus on hard examples
        # Reduce loss for easy examples
```
